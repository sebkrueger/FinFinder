# FinFinder

**FinFinder** is a language-based chatbot designed to identify and classify fish species found in German waters — 
including both the North Sea and Baltic Sea, as well as inland freshwater habitats. 

The aim is to provide users with a natural language interface to help determine fish species or at 
least categorize them taxonomically.

This project is a **demo application** exploring the integration of various AI and interface technologies.

A first prototype (`FirstPrototype.py`) can be found in the root directory of this repository. 
It features a simple Streamlit-based user interface that allows interaction with the agent via text input.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

The project currently uses the following technologies:

- **Streamlit** – Web UI framework for prototyping interactive apps
- **OpenAI GPT models** – Base for natural language processing and fish identification logic
- *(More to be added)*
